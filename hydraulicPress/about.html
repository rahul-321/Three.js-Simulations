				<span id="aboutText">
A hydraulic press is a device (see machine press) using a hydraulic cylinder to generate a compressive force. The hydraulic press depends on Pascal's principle-Pressure on a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished and acts with equal force on equal areas and at 90 degrees to the container wall.<br>



<h3>How to simulate:</h3>
Set values of external force and gravity , then press SIMULATE to perform the experiment. 
Once the parameters are set , they cannot be changed when the demo is running.
Press ASSESSMENT to solve problems.
Answer the questions by submitting a correct integer in the box near SUBMIT button in the assessment section.
You can answer questions in a level any number of times by re selecting the level.
The most recent submission for a question will be considered for score.
Once the END TEST button is pressed , no more questions can be solved. 

<br><br>

<h3>Learning Goals:</h3>

To understand the concept of mass density.<br>
To understand pressure in static fluids and gases.<br>
To use Archimede's Principle to understand bouyancy.<br>
To apply Pascal's law any apply it to solve problems.
