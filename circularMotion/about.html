				<span id="aboutText">
Circular Motion: It is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. Since the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation. Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion.<br>



<h3>How to simulate:</h3>
Set values of initial angular velocity and mass of bob , then press SIMULATE to perform the experiment.
Slide the Acceleration slider to change angular acceleration , it can also be changed when the demo is running.
Other parameters cannot be changed when the demo is running.
Press ASSESSMENT to solve problems.
Answer the questions by submitting a correct integer in the box near SUBMIT button in the assessment section.
You can answer questions in a level any number of times by re selecting the level.
The most recent submission for a question will be considered for score.
