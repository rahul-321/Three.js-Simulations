				<span id="aboutText">
 The projectile motion is a two dimensional motion with no force acting in the X direction and gravity acting in the Y direction. The resultant motion leads to a projectile motion.<br>



<h3>How to simulate:</h3>
Set values of angle, speed, mass and gravity, then press SIMULATE to perform the experiment.
Parameters cannot be changed when the demo is running. 
Press SIMULATE to perform experiment or GAME to play the game. The game consists of 4 questions. Your aim is set the target, the grey disc  so that the projectile hits it according to the given task.Use 'A' and 'D' key of the keybord to move the target left and right respectively. Press the play button to start the game , a projectile motion will start with some parameters. Then press  TASK to see the question . Then press SET TARGET button ,parameters will change according to the question , then set the target at correct position according to the new parameters.Then see the result.

<h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
To understand displacement, velocity, and acceleration in two dimensions.<br>
To understand projectile motion.<br>
To solve quantitative kinematics problems in two dimensions and to interpret the results.<br>
