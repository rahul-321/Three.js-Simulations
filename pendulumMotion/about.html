				<span id="aboutText">
 When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force combined with the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum's swing.<br>



<h3>How to simulate:</h3>
Set values of initial angle , length of rod , value of g and mass of bob , then press SIMULATE to perform the experiment. 
Once the parameters are set , they cannot be changed when the demo is running.
Press ASSESSMENT to solve problems.
Answer the questions  by submitting a correct integer in the box near SUBMIT button in the assessment section.
You can answer questions in a level any number of times by re selecting the level.
You can any time switch between levels.
The most recent submission for a question will be considered for score.
Once the END TEST button is pressed, no more questions can be solved.
